This directory contains the source files
that are used to build the Python API
for the SimulatorToFMU library.
***Linux**
To compile the files on Linux 
use the make files.

**Windows**
To compile the libraries on Windows
use the microsoft visual studio files (VC10\SimulatorToFMU) and create the
corresponding libraries for the correct target platform. The libraries will need to be 
copied to the appropriate library folder 
which are in SimulatorToFMU\simulatortofmu\parser\libraries\modelica\SimulatorToFMU\Resources\Library
